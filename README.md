# Introduction 🍁
### Hey ~there~ 💗
---
My name is **Zain** and I am in **9th** grade. I am taking this class because I would like to learn more about computer science and how it plays a role in real life.
I took robotics recently and have an *idea* of how code influences real life but I'd like to solely learn more about the markup language. 
[This](https://www.cs2n.org/u/track_progress?id=467) is the useful website I used to learn how to block code and configure it on VEX IQ robots. ⚡

I want a puppy like these ones...
